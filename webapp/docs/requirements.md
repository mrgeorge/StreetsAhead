# Installing Requirements
**Windows Users**:  *Please note that it is highly recommended that you first install
[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/install.html) in order to follow along with Unix based commands.*

**Mac OS X Users**: *Please be sure to install
[Xcode and command line tools](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329243/xcode-4-4-and-later-install-command-line-tools).
If these are already installed on your system, you can skip this step.*

## Accounts Setup
### Github
1. Sign up for a free [Github](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) account.
2. Download and Install [Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).
3. Add an [SSH Key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) to your Github account.

### Amazon AWS
1.  Open a web browser.
2.  Go to [aws.amazon.com](http://aws.amazon.com/). The AWS home page appears, containing an eye-catching
"Sign Up Now" button.
3.  Click the "Sign Up Now" button. You are redirected to an account sign-in page.
4.  Enter you e-mail address and select the radio button labelled, "I am a new user."
The "Login Credentials" page, first of the sign-up form pages, appears.
5.  Fill in the account form. This will look familiar to the billion people who have shopped online.
You must supply information about the customer, various ways of contacting the customer, a captcha-style security
check and agreement to terms and conditions.
6.  Find your credit card and fill in the payment form.
7.  Fill in the identity verification form. I received an automated message on my phone and had to type in a PIN
displayed in the web browser. A confirmation page appears. I also received a "welcome" e-mail, but did not have to
click on any activation link to make my account active.
8.  Close the web browser.

## System Requirements
### Python
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if it is not already installed. *By default python comes
installed in* **Mac OS X** and **Linux**.
2. Install [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html) if it is not already installed.

### Node/npm
3. Install [node](http://nodejs.org/download/) with npm.

    * **Windows users**: install the **.msi** Installer.
    * **Mac OS X users**: install the Universal (**.pkg**) Installer.
    * **Linux users**: visit this [link](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).
    *This program relies on the `node` binary, so you'll need to install the legacy version or create a symlink from
    `/usr/bin/node` to `/usr/bin/nodejs`.*

### MySQL
1. Install [MySQL](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
*Note: If you have a 64-bit computer, you should install the 64-bit version.*

    * **Windows/Linux users**: A powerful tool to help with managing your MySQL Databases is
    [MySQL Workbench](http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/).
    * **Mac OS X users**: Mac users should download the **Mac OS X 10.x DMG Archive**.
    In addition, [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) is a great tool for managing your MySQL databases for Macs.
