# Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Check to make sure the project requirements are installed. In the terminal, type:

    ```
    which python pip node npm
    ```

    The output should look similar to this:

    ```
    /usr/bin/python
    /usr/local/bin/pip
    /usr/local/bin/node
    /usr/local/bin/npm
    ```

    If one or more of the programs is not installed, please visit the
    [System Requirements](https://github.com/stormpython/insightfl/blob/develop/docs/requirements.md#system-requirements)
    guide.

2. Sign in to your [Github](https://github.com/) account.

    * Fork the [project](https://github.com/stormpython/insightfl) by clicking on `Fork` in the upper right hand corner
    of the screen.
    * Follow the [Dev Environment Setup](https://github.com/stormpython/insightfl#dev-environment-setup-) guide.

After you've completed setting up your development environment, go to the
[Launching an Amazon AWS EC2 Instance](https://github.com/stormpython/insightfl/blob/master/docs/launch-aws-ec2-instance.md#launching-an-amazon-aws-ec2-instance)
guide.
